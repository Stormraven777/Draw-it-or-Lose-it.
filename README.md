# Draw-it-or-Lose-it.
The Gameing Room client wanted a to create a web based game that is on multiple platforms
such as IOS, Android, Windows, Apple and Linux.  The game Draw it or Lose it is losely based on the 80's show Win,Lose or Draw.  
I think the code was done very well for this and so was the software design document.
I am not sure if there is anything that I would revise.
When doing a project like this the users needs are always something that you must pay attention to.  I looked at their needs and tried to make a program that would suit those needs.  In the future I think what I learned here will help in writing any other software projects that I write.  This project was helpful and having it saved here will be good so I can look back on it.
